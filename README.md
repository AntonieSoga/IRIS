# IRIS
IRIS is an Android application that emerged as the winning solution in a hackathon. Designed with a singular mission - to empower visually impaired individuals in navigating our university campus - 
IRIS leverages cutting-edge technologies including image processing, ML, TTS, and STT to provide an unprecedented level of independence and safety.

Hackathon Severin Bumbaru 2023.___

Developed an innovative app utilizing object detection, AI, TensorFlow,
Amazon Web Services, Google Vision, Google Speech to Text, and
image recognizers to assist visually impaired individuals in reading
text and avoiding object collisions.


I plan to revisit this project and take it to a whole new level, as my progress was constrained by the 48-hour time limit of the contest. 
Due to my commitments with jobs and college, I didn't have the necessary time to fully explore its potential. 
When I have the spare time and additional resources, I look forward to dedicating myself to expanding and elevating this project to new heights.
